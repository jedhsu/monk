//! [Duels]

//!   + The two competing networks are instantiated i32o two MCTS players
//!     of parameter `mcts` and then play `sim.num_games` games.
//!
//!   + The evaluated network replaces the current best one if its average
//!     collected reward is greater or equal than `update_threshold`.

//! [Odysseys]
//!
//!   + The two competing networks play `sim.num_games` games each.
//!
//!   + The evaluated network replaces the current best one if its average
//!     collected rewards exceeds the average collected reward of the
//!     old one by `update_threshold` at least.
//!
//!
//! Remarks
//!
//!   + See <`necessary_samples`>(@ref) to make an informed choice
//!     for `sim.num_games`.
//!
//!   + In the original AlphaGo Zero paper, 400 games are played to
//!     evaluate a network and the `update_threshold` parameter is
//!     set to a value that corresponds to a 55% win rate.
